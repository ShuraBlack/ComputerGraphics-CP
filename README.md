Professor Umlauf <br>

This lecture on computer graphics aims to provide a comprehensive overview of several key topics in the field. Beginning with rasterization, the process of converting vector graphics into a pixel-based format, the lecture will explore the fundamental principles of 2D and 3D transformation and projection. This includes an examination of the essential techniques used to manipulate and visualize objects within a virtual space.

The lecture will then delve into rendering techniques, specifically illumination, which plays a critical role in determining how light interacts with objects in a given scene. Finally, the topic of mapping will be covered, including the projection of textures and images onto 3D surfaces to achieve a higher level of realism.
